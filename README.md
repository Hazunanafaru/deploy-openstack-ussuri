# Deploy OpenStack Ussuri in Ubuntu 20.04

Technology : OpenStack Ussuri, Kolla-Ansible, and packstack

My best attempt to deploy OpenStack Ussri in Ubuntu 20.04

So far nothing works in this repo.

Deployment methods tried in this repo include
1. Manual deployment    : not success yet
2. PackStack            : it's for CentOS not for Ubuntu. not success yet
3. Kolla-Ansible        : failed in deployment phase. not success yet

For training and testing, I use EC2 instances in AWS.

For production I use in BTech Student Server.
